                The most iconic Air Jordan sneaker ever. The first, the ones that got banned by the NBA, the ones that people have been going crazy for since 1985. The Air Jordan 1 High.
            </p>

            <p>
                There have been a lot of different colors and styles since the shoes released in 1985, but the timeless design never gets boring. Even 37 years later, the J1 High is still the most popular sneaker and the hype is not going down anytime soon. 
            </p>

            <p>
                If you ask us what the best sneaker ever is, this is the one. The design, the comfort and the looks you can create, this shoe is just perfect. Everyone should have at least 1 pair of the J1 High, you simply can't dislike them.
